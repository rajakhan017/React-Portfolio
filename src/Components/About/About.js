      Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a
      Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing
      websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic design isn't just
      a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I work on.
      <br />
      <br /> Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages and I
      currently speak four of them fluently. I believe that this skill has given
      me a unique perspective and allows me to communicate effectively with
      clients from all over the world. One of my strengths is adding a personal
      touch to my projects by adding the client's identity and message into the
      design, creating meaningful and beautiful end products that are both
      eye-catching and user-friendly.
      <br />
      <br /> In my free time, I enjoy exploring my other passions, such as
      photography and music production, which provide me with creative outlets.
      I am also very passionate about Web3 and everything related to crypto,
      NFTs and blockchain technology as I believe they have the potential to
      revolutionize business and online interactions.
      <br />
      <br /> If you have an innovative idea for a project that needs to be
      developed, I would love to hear from you. Your vision can be turned into a
      real product. Don't hesitate to reach out and let's start a conversation
      about your concept. I'm excited to collaborate and help bring your ideas
      to life.
